# Summary
This program currently generates the mean average of the most common 5 colors in an image and creates a PNG containing those colors.

## Notes
You will need subdirectories after you clone - one named `images` that hosts your target images, and one named `averages` where the averages will be stored.

## Example:

#### Sample Image
!["./examples/example_image.png"](./examples/example_image.png)

#### Mean average of colors
!["./examples/mean.png"](./examples/mean_example.png)

#### Sample Image
!["./examples/DSC_0044.png"](./examples/DSC_0044.png)

#### Mean average of colors
!["./examples/DSC_0044.average.png"](./examples/DSC_0044.average.png)

#### Sample Image
!["./examples/DSC_0044.png"](./examples/DSC_0117.png)

#### Mean average of colors
!["./examples/DSC_0044.average.png"](./examples/DSC_0117.average.png)
